### Dataset
The dataset used in the project can be found here:
(https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)\
This is taken from the original dataset of "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" that can be found at [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones) along with feature desciptions.

### Background
The original dataset contains accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data of Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone collected using a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing the smartphone on the waist. 
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, they have captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) habve been pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). 
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. 
The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used.
From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

#### For each record it is provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.


### Tidy Dataset
The given dataset was compiled into a cleaned and avereged dataset with following steps.

1. Merged the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Usesd descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labeled the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
