## EDA of Electric Power consumption - Course Project 1


### Dataset Source

The dataset used in the project can be found here: [Electric Power consumption](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip)
This is taken from the original dataset of "Individual household electric power consumption" that can be found at [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/235/individual+household+electric+power+consumption) along with feature desciptions.


### Background

Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

#### Feature description:

1. date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
2. time: time in format hh:mm:ss
3. global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
4. global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
5. voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
6. global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
7. sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
8. sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
9. sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
